# Transition challenge #

## 1 When hovered a link should change color to the black: #000
## 2 Transition speed should be set to 1 second, and transition-timing-function should be ease-in-out
## 3 Transition should be triggered by hover


** There was an issue which took quite a lot of time, because I  couldn't see it: there is no space between word HOVER and " :"
* I've used Cloud9
* GitHub
* Boilerplates 

Thank you!
